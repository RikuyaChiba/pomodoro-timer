## What is pomodoro
Pomodoro is the time management technique to focus work, study etc.. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro,

## Usage 

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).[1]
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5–10 minutes).[5]
5. If you have finished fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
6. After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
